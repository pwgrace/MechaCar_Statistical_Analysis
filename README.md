## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
### The independent variables of vehicle length and ground clearance contributed a non-random amount of varience to the mpg values in the dataset because of the small Pr(>|t|) values. With a p-value of 5.35e-11, we can reject the null-hypothesis and state that there is a significant linear relationship and the slope of the linear model is not zero. An r-squared value of 0.72 indicates that this model is moderately sufficient to predict future observations. 
## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
### The manufacturing data does meet the design specification of not exceeding 100 PSI for the manufacturing lots in total because the varience plus standard deviation is less than 100. However, lot 3 does not meet the design specification on it's own by the same logic while lot 1 and 2 do meet the specification.
