## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
### The independent variables of vehicle length and ground clearance contributed a non-random amount of varience to the mpg values in the dataset because of the small Pr(>|t|) values. With a p-value of 5.35e-11, we can reject the null-hypothesis and state that there is a significant linear relationship and the slope of the linear model is not zero. An r-squared value of 0.72 indicates that this model is moderately sufficient to predict future observations.
